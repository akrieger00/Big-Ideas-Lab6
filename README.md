This program asks the user to enter a color from the rainbow. Their choices are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
If the user enters anything other than one of these colors, the program will tell the user the color choice is invalid and will prompt
them for a color again. Once a valid color is entered, the program will print out a statement that says the color the user chose and 
what the complimentary color is.
